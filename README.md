# ML-classifications
This repository contains my hands-on implementation of core Machine Learning classification algorithms using Python and Scikit-learn.
Each model is built from scratch following proper data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, and performance evaluation.

Algorithms covered include:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Decision Tree

Random Forest

For each algorithm, I focus on understanding the intuition, tuning key hyperparameters, and evaluating performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
This repository reflects my learning journey through classical ML classifiers and serves as a foundation for model comparison and real-world projects.

Tech stack: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
